    <p><strong>App:</strong> Dog Translator<br>

    <p><em>Effective date: November 21, 2025</em></p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>Dog Translator</strong>. Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information the app collects, how we use it, how we protect it, and your choices. By downloading, installing, or using the app, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>1. Information you provide directly</strong> — When you use features like voice recording or contact support, we may collect information you provide (for example: audio recordings, text messages you send to support, and any optional profile information).</p>

    <p><strong>2. Device and usage information</strong> — We automatically collect certain device information such as device model, operating system version, app version, and crash reports to help improve the app.</p>

    <p><strong>3. Permissions</strong> — The app requests access to the device <strong>Microphone</strong> to record sounds for translation. The app may also request access to local storage only if you explicitly use features that save or export files. You can revoke permissions at any time via your device settings; if you revoke the microphone permission, translation features that require audio will not work.</p>

    <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide, operate, and maintain the app’s core features (e.g., recording and translating dog sounds).</li>
      <li>To improve and personalize user experience and to analyze usage for app enhancements.</li>
      <li>To respond to user inquiries and provide support.</li>
      <li>To comply with legal obligations and enforce our Terms of Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
    <p>We do not sell your personal information. We may share information with the following third parties:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Service providers:</strong> Analytics, crash reporting, and hosting providers that assist us in operating the app. These providers are contractually prohibited from using data for other purposes.</li>
      <li><strong>Advertising partners:</strong> If you enable or view ads, we may share limited non-identifying information needed to serve relevant ads. See the Ads section below.</li>
      <li><strong>Legal requests:</strong> We may disclose information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, to protect our rights, or to comply with legal processes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ads and Analytics</h2>
    <p>If the app displays ads, we use ad networks which may collect non-personally-identifying information (for example: device identifiers and advertising identifiers) to serve and measure ads. You can opt out of personalized ads in your device ad settings where supported.</p>

    <h2>Data Safety for Google Play</h2>
    <p>For Google Play’s Data safety form, declare that this app:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Collects <strong>Audio</strong> data via the microphone — used for the app’s core functionality (translation).</li>
      <li>May collect <strong>Diagnostics</strong> (crash data) automatically for app stability.</li>
      <li>Does not collect or share <strong>Precise Location</strong>, <strong>Contacts</strong>, or <strong>Payment Info</strong> unless you explicitly provide such information in messages to support (which is not required).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Storage & Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain user data only as long as necessary to provide the service and improve app functionality. Audio recordings or logs that you explicitly save may be kept until you delete them. Crash logs and analytics data are retained in accordance with the policies of the analytics providers.</p>

    <h2>Security</h2>
    <p>We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data. However, no method of transmission or electronic storage is fully secure — absolute security cannot be guaranteed.</p>

    <h2>Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Revoke permissions:</strong> You can revoke microphone or storage permissions in device settings. Revoking microphone access will disable audio-based features.</li>
      <li><strong>Delete data:</strong> If the app stores any saved recordings or profile information on your device, you can delete them from within the app. Contact us at the email below if you need further assistance.</li>
      <li><strong>Opt out of analytics:</strong> Some analytics providers allow opting out. Check the app settings (if provided) or device-level privacy controls.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child under 13 provided us with personal information, contact us and we will take steps to delete that information.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will post the updated policy here with a new effective date. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance of the new policy.</p>
